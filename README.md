# Deque

This is an implementation of Deque in C++.

For this implementation i used a template class named Deque where i defined the next methods : 
 - a constructor to initialize the deque
 - push_front - add an element in front
 - push_back - add an element in back
 - pop_front - removing the element from the front
 - pop_back - removing the element from the back
 - erase - erase the element from a given position
 - insert - insert an element at a given position
 - front - return the front element
 - back - return the back element
 - print - print the elements and blocks where they belong
 - empty - check if structure is empty
 - size - return the number of elements
 - clear - remove all the elements
 - operator [] - return a reference at the element from the position given between the square bracket
